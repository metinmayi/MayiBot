# MayiBot
A discord bot that has been developed strictly for educational purposes.
The bot is created with discord.js, a NodeJS library. Additionally I use MongoDB to be able to setup user profiles with stored information.
In order to try the bot, you have to login to discord and connect to this server: https://discord.gg/FjeGD2xrYv.

Upon entering the server, the bot will DM you with instructions.
